Assume that there are n people on the island and c of them have blue eyes, and c>0;

Case c=1: Exactly one person has blue eyes.
This person should look around and realize that he is the only one that has blue eye, so he would take the flight that day.

Case c=2: Exactly two persons have blue eyes.
Two people look at each other, they are not sure whether c is 1 or 2. From the previous case, if c=1, the blue-eyed person would leave on the first night. Therefore, if the other blue-eyed person is still there, he must deduce that c=2, which means he himself is also blue-eyed. Both of these two persons would leave on the second night. 

Case c>2: The general case.
As we increase c, we can still follow the above logic. If c=3, these 3 people will immediately know that there are either 2 or 3 people with blue eyes. If there were 2 people, then those 2 people would have left on the second night. So when the others are still there after that night, each person would deduce that c=3 and these 3 people have blue eyes, they would leave on third night. 

The same pattern extends up through any value of c. Therefore, if c people have blue eyes, it will take c nights for the blue-eyed persons to leave.
