p is the probability of making a particular shot.

1) Probability of winning Game 1: p

2) Probability of winning Game 2:
P(G2) = p^3+3(1-p)^2 = 3p^2-2p^3

3) You should play G1 when p>(3p^2-2p^3) 
(2p-1)(p-1)>0, since p<1, p<1/2

So when p<0.5 we play G1. If p=0.5 or 1 or 0, it does not matter which game we play.
